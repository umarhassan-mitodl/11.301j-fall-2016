**City Making I: Planning the Formal City**

**Case Study: Private Development and Public Benefits**

Guest: [Kairos Shen](https://mitcre.mit.edu/kairos-shen), former Planning Director, City of Boston

The city is made largely by individual private development and projects, working within a framework of zonging and other regulations. Are these regulations sufficient to protect the public interest? What additional public benefits can the city expect developers to provide? Examples of projects and controversies in Boston.
